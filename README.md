## Replit
1. Fork the repo and connect Replit with your Github account.
2. Repl servers block most 18+ sites so you need a working SOCKS5 proxy to unblock those extensions. You can try searching online for free SOCKS5 proxies but most of them will probably be dead so you can either create a proxy server yourself or buy them. Now, if you finally get your hands on one, you can just edit the `server.conf` file and add the proxy if your repl is private or just put them as env variables if otherwise.
3. Now all you need to do is run the repl and you're good to go.

Note: Replit doesn't offer much storage even on paid plan so you should always turn off cache.
